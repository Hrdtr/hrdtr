Gelad is an application icon pack that I designed for my personal use, more precisely on smartphones. Each icon is designed from scratch, with glyph type and pop color combinations but not leaving the character of the original icon of the target application.

The design is made using Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Designer software, and the work is always ongoing because when I download a new application, I will create a new icon to match the theme of my smartphone.
